# Brush Automasking Flag Items

use_automasking_topology:
    

Topology.

Affect only vertices connected to the active vertex under the brush.

use_automasking_face_sets:
    

Face Sets.

Affect only vertices that share Face Sets with the active vertex.

use_automasking_boundary_edges:
    

Mesh Boundary Auto-Masking.

Do not affect non manifold boundary edges.

use_automasking_boundary_face_sets:
    

Face Sets Boundary Automasking.

Do not affect vertices that belong to a Face Set boundary.

use_automasking_cavity:
    

Cavity Mask.

Do not affect vertices on peaks, based on the surface curvature.

use_automasking_cavity_inverted:
    

Inverted Cavity Mask.

Do not affect vertices within crevices, based on the surface curvature.

use_automasking_custom_cavity_curve:
    

Custom Cavity Curve.
