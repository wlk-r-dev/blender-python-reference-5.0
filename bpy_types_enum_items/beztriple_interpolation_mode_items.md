# Beztriple Interpolation Mode Items

**Interpolation**

Standard transitions between keyframes.

CONSTANT:
    

Constant.

No interpolation, value of A gets held until B is encountered.

LINEAR:
    

Linear.

Straight-line interpolation between A and B (i.e. no ease in/out).

BEZIER:
    

Bézier.

Smooth interpolation between A and B, with some control over curve shape.

**Easing (by strength)**

Predefined inertial transitions, useful for motion graphics (from least to most “dramatic”).

SINE:
    

Sinusoidal.

Sinusoidal easing (weakest, almost linear but with a slight curvature).

QUAD:
    

Quadratic.

Quadratic easing.

CUBIC:
    

Cubic.

Cubic easing.

QUART:
    

Quartic.

Quartic easing.

QUINT:
    

Quintic.

Quintic easing.

EXPO:
    

Exponential.

Exponential easing (dramatic).

CIRC:
    

Circular.

Circular easing (strongest and most dynamic).

**Dynamic Effects**

Simple physics-inspired easing effects.

BACK:
    

Back.

Cubic easing with overshoot and settle.

BOUNCE:
    

Bounce.

Exponentially decaying parabolic bounce, like when objects collide.

ELASTIC:
    

Elastic.

Exponentially decaying sine wave, like an elastic band.
