# File Path Foreach Flag Items

SKIP_LINKED:
    

Skip Linked.

Skip paths of linked IDs.

SKIP_PACKED:
    

Skip Packed.

Skip paths when their matching data is packed.

RESOLVE_TOKEN:
    

Resolve Token.

Resolve tokens within a virtual filepath to a single, concrete, filepath. Currently only used for UDIM tiles.

SKIP_WEAK_REFERENCES:
    

Skip Weak References.

Skip weak reference paths. Those paths are typically ‘nice to have’ extra information, but are not used as actual source of data by the current .blend file.

SKIP_MULTIFILE:
    

Skip Multi-file.

Skip paths where a single dir is used with an array of files, eg. sequence strip images or point-caches. In this case only the first file path is processed. This is needed for directory manipulation callbacks which might otherwise modify the same directory multiple times.

RELOAD_EDITED:
    

Reload Edited.

Reload data when the path is edited.
