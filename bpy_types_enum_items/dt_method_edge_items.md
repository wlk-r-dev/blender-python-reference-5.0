# Dt Method Edge Items

TOPOLOGY:
    

Topology.

Copy from identical topology meshes.

VERT_NEAREST:
    

Nearest Vertices.

Copy from most similar edge (edge which vertices are the closest of destination edge’s ones).

NEAREST:
    

Nearest Edge.

Copy from closest edge (using midpoints).

POLY_NEAREST:
    

Nearest Face Edge.

Copy from closest edge of closest face (using midpoints).

EDGEINTERP_VNORPROJ:
    

Projected Edge Interpolated.

Interpolate all source edges hit by the projection of destination one along its own normal (from vertices).
