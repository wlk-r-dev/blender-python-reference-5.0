# Constraint Type Items

**Motion Tracking**

CAMERA_SOLVER:
    

Camera Solver.

FOLLOW_TRACK:
    

Follow Track.

OBJECT_SOLVER:
    

Object Solver.

**Transform**

COPY_LOCATION:
    

Copy Location.

Copy the location of a target (with an optional offset), so that they move together.

COPY_ROTATION:
    

Copy Rotation.

Copy the rotation of a target (with an optional offset), so that they rotate together.

COPY_SCALE:
    

Copy Scale.

Copy the scale factors of a target (with an optional offset), so that they are scaled by the same amount.

COPY_TRANSFORMS:
    

Copy Transforms.

Copy all the transformations of a target, so that they move together.

LIMIT_DISTANCE:
    

Limit Distance.

Restrict movements to within a certain distance of a target (at the time of constraint evaluation only).

LIMIT_LOCATION:
    

Limit Location.

Restrict movement along each axis within given ranges.

LIMIT_ROTATION:
    

Limit Rotation.

Restrict rotation along each axis within given ranges.

LIMIT_SCALE:
    

Limit Scale.

Restrict scaling along each axis with given ranges.

MAINTAIN_VOLUME:
    

Maintain Volume.

Compensate for scaling one axis by applying suitable scaling to the other two axes.

TRANSFORM:
    

Transformation.

Use one transform property from target to control another (or same) property on owner.

TRANSFORM_CACHE:
    

Transform Cache.

Look up the transformation matrix from an external file.

**Tracking**

CLAMP_TO:
    

Clamp To.

Restrict movements to lie along a curve by remapping location along curve’s longest axis.

DAMPED_TRACK:
    

Damped Track.

Point towards a target by performing the smallest rotation necessary.

IK:
    

Inverse Kinematics.

Control a chain of bones by specifying the endpoint target (Bones only).

LOCKED_TRACK:
    

Locked Track.

Rotate around the specified (‘locked’) axis to point towards a target.

SPLINE_IK:
    

Spline IK.

Align chain of bones along a curve (Bones only).

STRETCH_TO:
    

Stretch To.

Stretch along Y-Axis to point towards a target.

TRACK_TO:
    

Track To.

Legacy tracking constraint prone to twisting artifacts.

**Relationship**

ACTION:
    

Action.

Use transform property of target to look up pose for owner from an Action.

ARMATURE:
    

Armature.

Apply weight-blended transformation from multiple bones like the Armature modifier.

CHILD_OF:
    

Child Of.

Make target the ‘detachable’ parent of owner.

FLOOR:
    

Floor.

Use position (and optionally rotation) of target to define a ‘wall’ or ‘floor’ that the owner cannot cross.

FOLLOW_PATH:
    

Follow Path.

Use to animate an object/bone following a path.

GEOMETRY_ATTRIBUTE:
    

Geometry Attribute.

Retrieve transform from target geometry attribute data.

PIVOT:
    

Pivot.

Change pivot point for transforms (buggy).

SHRINKWRAP:
    

Shrinkwrap.

Restrict movements to surface of target mesh.
