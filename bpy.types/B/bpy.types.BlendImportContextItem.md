# BlendImportContextItem(bpy_struct)

base class — [[bpy_struct]]

_class _bpy.types.BlendImportContextItem(_bpy_struct_)
    

An item (representing a data-block) in a BlendImportContext data. Currently only exposed as read-only data for the pre/post linking handlers

append_action
    

How this item has been handled by the append operation. Only set if the data has been appended

  * `UNSET` Not yet defined.

  * `KEEP_LINKED` ID has been kept linked.

  * `REUSE_LOCAL` An existing matching local ID has been re-used.

  * `MAKE_LOCAL` The newly linked ID has been made local.

  * `COPY_LOCAL` The linked ID had other unrelated usages, so it has been duplicated into a local copy.


Type:
    

enum in [`'UNSET'`, `'KEEP_LINKED'`, `'REUSE_LOCAL'`, `'MAKE_LOCAL'`, `'COPY_LOCAL'`], default `'UNSET'`, (readonly)

id
    

The imported ID. None until it has been linked or appended. May be the same as `reusable_local_id` when appended

Type:
    

[[ID]], (readonly)

id_type
    

ID type of the item

Type:
    

enum in [Id Type Items](../../bpy_types_enum_items/id_type_items.md#rna-enum-id-type-items), default `'ACTION'`, (readonly)

import_info
    

Various status info about an item after it has been imported

  * `INDIRECT_USAGE` That item was added for an indirectly imported ID, as a dependency of another data-block.

  * `LIBOVERRIDE_DEPENDENCY` That item represents an ID also used as liboverride dependency (either directly, as a liboverride reference, or indirectly, as data used by a liboverride reference). It should never be directly made local. Mutually exclusive with `LIBOVERRIDE_DEPENDENCY_ONLY`.

  * `LIBOVERRIDE_DEPENDENCY_ONLY` That item represents an ID only used as liboverride dependency (either directly or indirectly, see `LIBOVERRIDE_DEPENDENCY` for precisions). It should not be considered during the ‘make local’ (append) process, and remain purely linked data. Mutually exclusive with `LIBOVERRIDE_DEPENDENCY`.


Type:
    

enum set in {`'INDIRECT_USAGE'`, `'LIBOVERRIDE_DEPENDENCY'`, `'LIBOVERRIDE_DEPENDENCY_ONLY'`}, default set(), (readonly)

library_override_id
    

The library override of the linked ID. None until it has been created

Type:
    

[[ID]], (readonly)

name
    

ID name of the item

Type:
    

string, default “”, (readonly, never None)

reusable_local_id
    

The already existing local ID that may be reused in append & reuse case. None until it has been found

Type:
    

[[ID]], (readonly)

source_libraries
    

List of libraries to search and import that ID from. The ID will be imported from the first file in that list that contains it

Type:
    

[[BlendImportContextLibraries]] [[bpy_prop_collection]] of [[BlendImportContextLibrary]], (readonly)

source_library
    

Library ID representing the blendfile from which the ID was imported. None until the ID has been linked or appended

Type:
    

[[Library]], (readonly)
