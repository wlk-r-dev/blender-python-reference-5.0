# GeometrySet

## Accessing Evaluated Geometry
    
    
    import bpy
    
    # The GeometrySet can only be retrieved from an evaluated object. So one always
    # needs a depsgraph that has evaluated the object.
    depsgraph = bpy.context.view_layer.depsgraph
    ob = bpy.context.active_object
    ob_eval = depsgraph.id_eval_get(ob)
    
    # Get the final evaluated geometry of an object.
    geometry = ob_eval.evaluated_geometry()
    
    # Print basic information like the number of elements.
    print(geometry)
    
    # A geometry set may have a name. It can be set with the Set Geometry Name node.
    print(geometry.name)
    
    # Access "realized" geometry components.
    print(geometry.mesh)
    print(geometry.pointcloud)
    print(geometry.curves)
    print(geometry.volume)
    print(geometry.grease_pencil)
    
    # Access the mesh without final subdivision applied.
    print(geometry.mesh_base)
    
    # Accessing instances is a bit more tricky, because there is no specific
    # mechanism to expose instances. Instead, two accessors are provided which
    # are easy to keep working in the future even if we get a proper Instances type.
    
    # This is a pointcloud that provides access to all the instance attributes.
    # There is a point per instances. May return None if there is no instances data.
    instances_pointcloud = geometry.instances_pointcloud()
    
    if instances_pointcloud is not None:
        # This is a list containing the data that is instanced. The list may contain
        # None, objects, collections or other GeometrySets. If the geometry does not
        # have instances, the list is empty.
        references = geometry.instance_references()
    
        # Besides normal generic attributes, there are also two important
        # instance-specific attributes. "instance_transform" is a 4x4 matrix attribute
        # containing the transforms of each instance.
        instance_transforms = instances_pointcloud.attributes["instance_transform"]
    
        # ".reference_index" contains indices into the `references` list above and
        # determines what geometry each instance uses.
        reference_indices = instances_pointcloud.attributes[".reference_index"]
    

_class _bpy.types.GeometrySet
    

Stores potentially multiple geometry components of different types. For example, it might contain a mesh, curves and nested instances.

instance_references()
    

This returns a list of geometries that is indexed by the `.reference_index` attribute of the pointcloud returned by `bpy.types.GeometrySet.instances_pointcloud()`. It may contain other geometry sets, objects, collections and None values.

Return type:
    

list[None | [bpy.types.Object](../O/bpy.types.Object.md#bpy.types.Object "bpy.types.Object") | [bpy.types.Collection](../C/bpy.types.Collection.md#bpy.types.Collection "bpy.types.Collection") | bpy.types.GeometrySet]

instances_pointcloud()
    

Get a pointcloud that encodes information about the instances of the geometry. The returned pointcloud should not be modified. There is a point per instance and per-instance data is stored in point attributes. The local transforms are stored in the `instance_transform` attribute. The data instanced by each point is referenced by the `.reference_index` attribute, indexing into the list returned by `bpy.types.GeometrySet.instance_references()`.

Return type:
    

[bpy.types.PointCloud](../P/bpy.types.PointCloud.md#bpy.types.PointCloud "bpy.types.PointCloud")

curves
    

The curves data-block in the geometry set.

Type:
    

[[bpy.types.Curves]]

grease_pencil
    

The Grease Pencil data-block in the geometry set.

Type:
    

[[bpy.types.GreasePencil]]

mesh
    

The mesh data-block in the geometry set.

Type:
    

[[bpy.types.Mesh]]

mesh_base
    

The mesh data-block in the geometry set without final subdivision.

Type:
    

[[bpy.types.Mesh]]

name
    

The name of the geometry set. It can be used for debugging purposes and is not unique.

Type:
    

str

pointcloud
    

The point cloud data-block in the geometry set.

Type:
    

[[bpy.types.PointCloud]]

volume
    

The volume data-block in the geometry set.

Type:
    

[[bpy.types.Volume]]

_static _from_evaluated_object(_evaluated_object_)
    

Create a geometry set from the evaluated geometry of an evaluated object. Typically, it’s more convenient to use [[bpy.types.Object.evaluated_geometry()]].

Parameters:
    

**evaluated_object** ([_bpy.types.Object_](../O/bpy.types.Object.md#bpy.types.Object "bpy.types.Object")) – The evaluated object to create a geometry set from.
